# SPDX Identifiers

[![REUSE status](
    https://api.reuse.software/badge/github.com/hoijui/SPDX-identifiers)](
    https://api.reuse.software/info/github.com/hoijui/SPDX-identifiers)

This repo contains a simple list of all [SPDX license identifiers](licenses.csv),
plus one of all the [exceptions](exceptions.csv) to these licenses.
The whole repo is generated by extracting data from [license-list-XML](https://github.com/spdx/license-list-XML),
just like its bigger sibling [license-list-data](https://github.com/spdx/license-list-data),
which contains _a lot_ more data.
The code that generates this repo can be found at [hoijui/SPDX-identifiers-generator](https://github.com/hoijui/SPDX-identifiers-generator).

The `master` branch of this repo will always correspond
to the latest release of the original repo.
The data can be found in 1 column CSV files without a header row,
or in other words, a text file with one identifier per line.

## Licensing

While a lot of the data in the repo we extract the SPDX identifiers from
is under different licenses, as it originates from various other places,
the SPDX and exception identifiers themselves are provided under CC0-1.0 by SPDX.

This repo uses both the [REUSE](https://reuse.software/) way of indicating licenses
(note the LICENSES folder in this repo),
and the less precise but more common way of having a single LICENSE file,
as this is more commonly supported and understood, both by humans and machines.
